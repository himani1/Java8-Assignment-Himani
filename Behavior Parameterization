1. (a) You are familiar with Twitter posts. A Twitter post contains attributes like Like, Shares and Retweets. A Timeline is defined by the list of posts
which are sorted by some random criteria. You task is to write Comparator<Post> to sort the Timeline by the following attributes:
1. Latest Post (Newer to Older)
2. Number of Retweets (Higher to Lower)
3. Number of Likes (Higher to Lower)
4. Number of Shares (Higher to Lower)

1. (b) Write a prettyPrint method for printing the Posts on the console. A prettyPrint method prints a Post in the following format:
{ (Post attribute) -> [value], (Another Post attribute) -> value)  

You can pull the Tweets from your own profile. To get the tweets your application needs to be registered with twitter. For more instruction please
